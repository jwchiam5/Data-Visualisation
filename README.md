# Data-Visualisation CA2 assignment
In this data visualization assignment, the focal point is Singapore's intricate land public transport system. 
Leveraging the power of Seaborn and Plotly, we aim to create compelling visualizations and derive meaningful insights from the provided datasets: Bus_routes, Bus_services, and Bus_stops (a maximum of 5 datasets).
We were required to come up with 2 objectives and for each objective, plot 3 charts. (Total of 6 different charts)
